# About the project
Resmind is a library with different scripts, utils, services and functions useful when doing research. 

The development of this library was initiated to address the need for automation of specific operations when conducting a systematic review in a tech field. Conducting this research has led to the realisation that certain steps or processes are very repetitive and can be automated to improve productivity and efficiency, and to make certain parts of the research less tedious.


# Development

Development was initiated with the implementation of the research documentation in LaTeX, in the form of simple scripts. Recognising the value of creating a library that encapsulates useful functionalities for research purposes and facilitates reproducibility in other projects, the decision was taken to migrate all code to the library project, and to start developing different functionalities to apply in the projects.



## Tools Used

- python -> python is the core programming language used for the development of resmind
- pipx -> Tool that enables the installation and execution of python applications in isolated environments. 
- poetry -> Tool for dependency management and packaging in Python, allowing to to declare the libraries the project depends on and will manage (install/update) them automatically without involving a developer.
